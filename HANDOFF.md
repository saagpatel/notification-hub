# Handoff — notification-hub

**Status:** First-rich queue guard implemented; rich follow-up review remains visible
**Branch:** codex/guard-thin-first-proof
**Last verified remote commit before this pass:** cf40318 (main after first-rich proof gate)
**Tests:** full verification pending for this branch; targeted tests, Ruff, and Pyright passed

## Completed This Session

- **2026-05-30 dependency closeout** — cleared the open Dependabot lane, verified `main` /
  `origin/main` at `4c2e5f0`, confirmed GitHub CI and CodeQL success, and restarted the daemon
  after dependency updates so live runtime uses the final merged dependency set.
- **2026-05-30 first-rich proof gate** — Coordination Console now emits a structured
  `first_rich_handoff_gate`, and `/review` renders it as a First Rich Proof Gate with
  active rich/thin counts, queue lifecycle counts, resolved rich outcome count, candidate action
  ids, and the exact safe next action.
- **2026-05-30 first-rich queue guard** — thin-only `Codex is waiting` was recorded locally as
  `needs_follow_up`, making it handled history. `/review` now hides queue controls for thin or
  mixed first-proof groups, and the queue path rejects unsafe first-proof selections unless they
  contain exactly one rich-evidence handoff.
- **2026-05-30 runtime readiness cleanup** — burn-in now ignores daemon log files whose mtime is
  outside the requested burn-in window, so stale Slack/validation evidence does not block fresh
  runtime readiness.
- **2026-05-30 personal-ops noise cleanup** — added a `Task suggestion pending` noise rule to the
  repo sample policy and the live local policy config; repeated task suggestions now remain
  policy-covered history instead of active noise candidates.
- **2026-05-30 mail draft noise cleanup** — added a `Draft Updated` mail noise rule to the repo
  sample policy and the live local policy config after fresh burn-in surfaced repeated
  informational draft-update events.
- **2026-05-30 Slack delivery verification** — explicit Slack transport check passed and sent one
  real transport-check notification.
- **2026-05-30 dashboard freshness improvement** — `/review` now separates live runtime status
  from saved burn-in proof, warns when the latest saved proof is older than seven days, and shows
  daemon uptime in the top summary.
- **2026-05-30 dashboard readiness explanation** — `/review` now names readiness blockers when
  degraded and confirms runtime, policy, queue, and saved burn-in proof when ready.
- **2026-05-30 LaunchAgent refresh** — restarted the live daemon after operator approval; live
  `/review` now reports `ready_to_expand` and monitor mode.
- **2026-05-30 fresh proof** — saved
  `/Users/d/.local/share/notification-hub/burn-in-reports/personal-ops-queue-burn-in-20260530-110041.json`
  with runtime OK, queue OK, and zero noise candidates.
- **2026-05-30 local state cleanup** — `.claude/` is now ignored as Claude-owned local state.
- **2026-05-30 Dependabot/Pyright readiness** — diagnosed PR #49's failed Pyright 1.1.409 check
  and updated the FastAPI lifespan annotation from `AsyncIterator` to `AsyncGenerator`; pinned
  Pyright and `pyright==1.1.409` now pass locally.
- **PR #37** — `action-export-retention` CLI: prune action-export files, dry-run by default, `--apply` to delete, `--keep N`; first run pruned 20 files
- **PR #38** — `near_rollup_singles`: surfaces count=1 inbox events invisible to rollup pipeline; new field on `InboxReport`, wired into `run_inbox` and CLI display
- **PR #39** — `docs/CURRENT-STATE.md` updated to reflect session 2 state
- **PR #40** — `mcp_server` smoke tests: 9 in-process tests covering all 7 tool wrappers via FastMCP Client + AsyncMock; replaced dead echo-tool stub
- **2026-05-16 next pass** — fixed Pyright's private-helper test import warning, refreshed `docs/CURRENT-STATE.md`, and intentionally kept `.claude/` plus this handoff artifact
- **2026-05-16 CI follow-up** — added `uv run --directory mcp_server --frozen pytest` to GitHub Actions, switched CI install to `uv sync --frozen --group dev`, and documented the separate MCP test command
- **2026-05-16 real-use burn-in** — exercised `/review`, Coordination Console, inbox `near_rollup_singles`, queue health, runtime status, and 60-minute burn-in against live signals
- **2026-05-16 local handoff closeout** — saved/validated/queued a focused sync-degraded review package, then marked the two queued mailbox/calendar handoff items reviewed after source checks recovered enough that no downstream promotion was appropriate
- **2026-05-16 proposal cleanup** — saved/validated `personal-ops-actions-20260516-193841-085944.json`, dismissed stale recovered personal-ops mailbox-sync and Hermes watchdog proposal keys, and verified Coordination Console returned to monitor mode
- **2026-05-17 calendar proposal cleanup** — saved/validated `personal-ops-actions-20260517-033110-245366.json`, dismissed a stale recovered calendar-sync proposal, and verified Coordination Console returned to monitor mode
- **2026-05-17 compact expansion** — terminal local group outcomes now count as handled lineage: `accepted` resolved, `rejected`/`superseded` closed, `snoozed` snoozed, and `needs_follow_up` follow-up
- **2026-05-17 stale draft cleanup** — created fresh personal-ops recovery snapshot `2026-05-17T03-44-01Z`, routed draft artifact `aa8fd718-51cb-4285-9833-edee718f8706` through approval request `6991ef3e-9ff6-47a9-8304-cf0d259729b2`, rejected it as verification-only stale work, and verified the local draft record is `rejected` / `resolved`
- **2026-05-17 post-cleanup observation** — rechecked status, logs, burn-in, inbox, personal-ops health, and Coordination Console; no ADR 0001 trigger appeared, and the only new `near_rollup_singles` item was the cleanup approval echo

## In Progress

- Source-tree and live browser/API verification reported notification-hub healthy after dependency
  closeout.
- Coordination Console can now show an active proposal while keeping first-rich proof collection
  operator-mediated until one rich promoted handoff resolves.
- `/review` now makes the main Real Signal Readiness panel less ambiguous about live health versus
  saved proof, explains the Coordination Readiness gate, shows daemon uptime, and renders the
  structured First Rich Proof Gate for the first proof workflow.

## Blocked

- None.

## Next Steps

1. **Review the current rich handled follow-up** — fresh personal-ops mail evidence rotated under
   prior `needs_follow_up` history during verification; do not queue or promote it without an
   explicit operator decision.
2. **Use the First Rich Proof Gate on the next real rich proposal** — save and validate the package,
   queue exactly one rich handoff, and record the promoted outcome before widening authority.
3. **Resolve ADR 0001 later** — lineage rich-vs-thin supersession is still deferred until a real promoted/resolved rich handoff appears under a prior `needs_follow_up` stable key
4. **Observe `near_rollup_singles` in real use** — tune only if one-off resolved echoes or informational first occurrences become repeated operator noise

## Key Decisions

- `near_rollup_singles` reuses `InboxRollupReport` TypedDict (avoids new type)
- mcp_server tests patch `server._get`/`server._post` at module level — no live daemon required
- ADR 0001 left deferred-open; needs real-use data before closing
- Direct private-helper coverage is kept with a narrow Pyright ignore instead of widening the helper's public API
- The 2026-05-16 sync-degraded package was kept as local evidence, but the two handoffs were closed as reviewed rather than promoted because source checks recovered and no downstream personal-ops work was appropriate
- Stale recovered proposal keys are better handled with local dismissals than queueing: this clears monitor noise while allowing distinct future failures to appear under different keys
- A terminal group outcome should also clear matching future repeats without requiring a separate dismissal; this is now covered by a regression test for `superseded`
- The stale rich-evidence pipeline draft does not need to be sent or promoted; the supported cleanup path is local approval request plus rejection, leaving the personal-ops record resolved without direct database mutation
- A one-off `near_rollup_singles` cleanup echo is an observation, not a suppression trigger; wait for repeated operator noise before adding policy or code
- Stale daemon log files should not drive current burn-in health; the logs surface can still show
  tails for inspection, while burn-in readiness follows the requested time window.
- The repeated personal-ops task-suggestion lane is intentionally policy-covered local noise, not a
  proposal source, unless a future distinct task-suggestion signal needs operator action.
- Repeated informational mail `Draft Updated` events are policy-covered local noise; they are still
  visible as repeated signatures but should not block burn-in readiness.
- The Real Signal Readiness panel should treat saved burn-in proof freshness separately from live
  runtime health; proof older than seven days is useful history, not fresh readiness evidence.
- Live daemon UI/API posture can lag source-tree fixes until the LaunchAgent is restarted; use the
  `/review` uptime metric plus `launchctl print` when checking process freshness.
- FastAPI lifespan functions decorated with `@asynccontextmanager` should return
  `AsyncGenerator[...]`, not `AsyncIterator[...]`, for Pyright 1.1.409+ compatibility.
